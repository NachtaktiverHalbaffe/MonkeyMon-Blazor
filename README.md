# MonkeyMon-Blazor
A example React project to dive deeper into React and popular packages around it. Just a useless idea which purpose is to play around with all fun aspects of React. **It's my personal playground.**

The project builds around the [Pokeapi](https://pokeapi.co/). You need CORS to be disabled in your browser in order for my own API to work

# Project Idea
It's a project to dive into React and experiment with it, so the Application itself is useless and is tailored to cover as most topics as possible. Its the same idea as [MonkeyMon](https://github.com/NachtaktiverHalbaffe/MonkeyMon/tree/main) which was another learning project for Flutter.

At it's core, the application fetches data from [Pokeapi](https://pokeapi.co/) and custom backend for Monkeys, caches the data in a powerful local database and shows the entries in a Pokedex and a Mondex (a Pokedex for my Monkey API). Either a Pokemon or a monkey can be send into the arena where they can fight each other like in Pokemon.
